                The purpose of this document is to be an overview of the code; 
                this program is intended as a fresh rebuild to Realpolitik, an adjudicator for Diplomacy.

            <h2>
                History
            </h2>
            <p>
                From the Realpolitik Technical Manual, Jim Van Verth:
            </p>
            <p>"Realpolitik began as a Unix program, written to moderate games amongst my friends. While 
                the games ended (sorry Gus), I continued working on the program. Originally 
                I intended it to be a mail server, but gave that up after being introduced 
                to the Judge. However, seeing MapIt gave me the idea of giving it a graphical 
                interface and running it on the Macintosh. MacDip was born. I continued 
                working on MacDip for a few years until circumstances led me to pull it 
                from distribution. But after I saw other programs continue, I brought 
                MacDip back, in a new incarnation: Realpolitik. The following years saw 
                a port of Realpolitik to Windows, and then a cross platform version with 
                shared data files and common code. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "This rather checkered 
                resolution code, and it has a definite vanilla C feel to it. There are 
                history has led to some rather checkered code. The oldest code is the 
                parts are the platform specific classes, which are fairly object-oriented, 
                some #defines which act like C++ methods, but it's basically C. The newest 
                but there are, admittedly, some hacks."
            </p>
            <p>
                The rational behind doing a full rebuild of the software is the prevalence of 
                web based diplomacy games has crowded out the desktop adjudicators. Therefor, I 
                want to develop a platform to expand upon Realpolitik to add new capabilities into 
                program that allow it to thrive in a world that's constantly changing.

            <h3>
                New File Formats
            </h3>
            <p>
                One of the major limitations I ran into was the lack of a standard to transfer information 
                between different softwares. I suspect this will still be the case for a long time, but I expect 
                that the current methods of storing game data (platform specific or images) will eventually transition 
                (towards platform agnostic). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I'm focusing on two file formats. The code to read these formats should be able to be easily 
                expanded with additional parsing modules.
            </p>
            <p>
                .dpy -- These are the diplomacy game files, that call a .dpymap file and overwrite the initial gamestate. 
                The .dpy file can store moves as a history of gamestates (turn-state), or as a pure order list (tracking), or both. 
                The issue with pure order list is that if anything breaks, everything breaks (one change tracks into the next game state). 
                The default behavior is that turn-state data overwrites tracking information. This might create issues 
            </p>
            <p>
                .dpymap -- These files wrap up many Realpolitik files into one, with subsections in the file. The header of a map file needs to match 
                the game file being loaded, otherwise bad things... 
                The map files hold all the data relating to the map. Map files should be able to call other mapfiles as dependancies (mainly to reduce 
                the amount of svg data that needs to be stored[avoid circular loops in dependancies]).
