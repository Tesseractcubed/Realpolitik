README file.

This project is an attempt to rebuild Realpolitik into a program that does 3 parts: 
interface with players, adjudicate, and peer to peer / peer to server communication. 
The version will be a full number upgrade should it publish.

(^For working purposes)

Measurable Goals: 
Backwards compatability with Realpolitik, probably one way upgrade of files. (Medium)
Set standards to load games, maps, rulesets, and adjudicators into program. (Main goal)
Create logic to load datapacks synchronously across platforms.
C++ and python cross compatability for rulesets.
Start at windows / linux application, expand outwards.
Functionally equivalent at minimum to Realpolitik (Latest Version)

Version History:

2.0.0.1
